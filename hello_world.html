    <br>
    <p>Welcome to my first blog post. My name is Mihir Gupta and I'm a first year</p>
    <p>Computer Engineering student in stream 4 at the University of Waterloo.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My goal for this blog is to write about my experiences as a UWaterloo student</p>
    <p>and new technologies that I have learnt in my future ECE courses or in my</p>
    <p>spare time. Some things I plan to learn during my first coop term and over the</p>
    <p>Winter Break are Android Development, JavaScript and the React Framework, and</p>
    <p>Tensorflow.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I would also like to take the time to pursue my other hobbies, such as photography,</p>
    <p>and hiking. I also want to take some time to relax and take care of my mental health</p>
    <p>after a stressful online 1A term.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To end off this blog post, I would like to share a joke that made me smile.</p>
    <br>
    <p><i>A group of engineering professors were invited to fly in a plane. Right after they</i></p>
    <p><i>were comforable seated, they were informed the plane was built by there students.</i></p>
    <p><i>All but one got off their seats and headed frantically to the exits in maniacal</i></p>
    <p><i>panic. The one lone professor that stayed sitting calmly in his seat was asked
    <p><i>"Why did you stay put?". He replied "I have plenty of confidence in my students.</i></p>
    <p><i>Knowing them, I can assure you this plane will never event start."</i></p>
    <br></br>
